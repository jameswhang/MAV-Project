## RGB-D SLAM for MAVs Autonomous Indoor Navigation
### Directories
`HSR` folder contains the code developed by Gian and Michael from HSR (Hochschule f√ºr Technik Rapperswil). They started this RGB-D SLAM project by coding up the initial hand-held SLAM which I used to implement on the quadrotor. 

`util` contains some setup files and documentations (need rename, update and clean up')

`px4_ws`is the workspace that contains all the ROS packages we implemented on the ODROID. Note that we use a Pixhawk flight controller for our low level control and we modified their Firmware to suit our need. Here's the Firmware repo. https://github.com/tuofeichen/Firmware
